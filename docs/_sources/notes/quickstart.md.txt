## Quick Start

Let us skim through the whole package to find what you want. 

### Dataloader

Load common used dataset and preprocess for you:

* Download online resources or import from local
* Split training set, development set and test set
* Construct vocabulary list

```python
    >>> # automatically download online resources
    >>> dataloader = cotk.dataloader.MSCOCO("resources://MSCOCO_small")
    >>> # or download from a url
    >>> dl_url = cotk.dataloader.MSCOCO("http://cotk-data.s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/mscoco_small.zip#MSCOCO")
    >>> # or import form local file
    >>> dl_zip = cotk.dataloader.MSCOCO("./MSCOCO.zip#MSCOCO")
    
    >>> print("Dataset is split into:", dataloader.key_name)
    ["train", "dev", "test"]
```

Inspect vocabulary list

```python
    >>> print("Vocabulary size:", dataloader.vocab_size)
    Vocabulary size: 2588
    >>> print("Frist 10 tokens in vocabulary:", dataloader.vocab_list[:10])
    Frist 10 tokens in vocabulary: ['<pad>', '<unk>', '<go>', '<eos>', '.', 'a', 'A', 'on', 'of', 'in']
```

Convert between ids and strings

```python
    >>> print("Convert string to ids", \
    ...           dataloader.convert_tokens_to_ids(["<go>", "hello", "world", "<eos>"]))
    Convert string to string [2, 1379, 1897, 3]
    >>> print("Convert ids to string", \
    ...           dataloader.convert_ids_to_tokens([2, 1379, 1897, 3]))
```

Iterate over batches

```python
    >>> for data in dataloader.get_batch("train", batch_size=1):
    ...     print(data)
    {'sent':
        array([[ 2, 181, 13, 26, 145, 177, 8, 22, 12, 5, 1, 1099, 4, 3]]),
        # <go> This is an old photo of people and a <unk> wagon.
     'sent_allvocabs':
        array([[ 2, 181, 13, 26, 145, 177, 8, 22, 12, 5, 3755, 1099, 4, 3]]),
        # <go> This is an old photo of people and a horse-drawn wagon.
     'sent_length': array([14])}
    ......
```

or using ``while`` if you like

```python
    >>> dataloader.restart("train", batch_size=1):
    >>> while True:
    ...    data = dataloader.get_next_batch("train")
    ...    if data is None: break
    ...    print(data)
```

.. note::

   If you want to know more about data loader, please refer to :mod:`docs <cotk.dataloader>`.


### Metrics

We found there are different versions of the same metric in released codes on Github,
which leads to unfair compare between models. For example, whether considering
``unk``, calculating the mean of NLL across sentences or tokens in
``perplexity`` may introduce **an error of several times** and **extremely** harm the evaluation.

We provide unified metrics implementation for all models. The metric object
receives data in batch.

```python
    >>> metric = cotk.metric.SelfBleuCorpusMetric(dataloader, gen_key="gen")
    >>> metric.forward({
    ...    "gen":
    ...        [[2, 181, 13, 26, 145, 177, 8, 22, 12, 5, 3755, 1099, 4, 3],
    ...         [2, 46, 145, 500, 1764, 207, 11, 5, 93, 7, 31, 4, 3]]
    ... })
    >>> print(metric.close())
    {'self-bleu': 0.02206768072402293,
     'self-bleu hashvalue': 'c206893c2272af489147b80df306ee703e71d9eb178f6bb06c73cb935f474452'}
```

We also provide standard metrics for selected dataloader.

```python
    >>> metric = dataloader.get_inference_metric(gen_key="gen")
    >>> metric.forward({
    ...    "gen":
    ...        [[2, 181, 13, 26, 145, 177, 8, 22, 12, 5, 3755, 1099, 4, 3],
    ...         [2, 46, 145, 500, 1764, 207, 11, 5, 93, 7, 31, 4, 3]]
    ... })
    >>> print(metric.close())
    {'self-bleu': 0.02206768072402293,
     'self-bleu hashvalue': 'c206893c2272af489147b80df306ee703e71d9eb178f6bb06c73cb935f474452',
     'fw-bleu': 0.3831004349785445, 'bw-bleu': 0.025958979254273006, 'fw-bw-bleu': 0.04862323612604027,
     'fw-bw-bleu hashvalue': '530d449a096671d13705e514be13c7ecffafd80deb7519aa7792950a5468549e',
     'gen': [
         ['<go>', 'This', 'is', 'an', 'old', 'photo', 'of', 'people', 'and', 'a', 'horse-drawn', 'wagon', '.'],
         ['<go>', 'An', 'old', 'stone', 'castle', 'tower', 'with', 'a', 'clock', 'on', 'it', '.']
     ]}
```

``Hash value`` is provided for checking whether the same dataset is used.

.. note::

   If you want to know more about metrics, please refer to :mod:`docs <cotk.metric>`.


### Publish Experiments

We provide an online dashboard to manage your experiments.

Here we give an simple example for you.

First initialize a git repo in your command line.

```bash
    git init
```

Then write your model with an entry function in ``main.py``.

```python
    import cotk.dataloader
    import json

    def run():
        dataloader = cotk.dataloader.MSCOCO("resources://MSCOCO_small")
        metric = dataloader.get_inference_metric()
        metric.forward({
            "gen":
                [[2, 181, 13, 26, 145, 177, 8, 22, 12, 5, 3755, 1099, 4, 3],
                [2, 46, 145, 500, 1764, 207, 11, 5, 93, 7, 31, 4, 3]]
        })
        json.dump(metric.close(), open("result.json", 'w'))
```

.. note::

    The only requirement of your model is to output a file named ``result.json``,
    you can do whatever you want (even don't load data using ``cotk``).

Next, commit your changes and set upstream branch in your command line.

```bash
    git add -A
    git commit -a -m "init"
    git remote add origin master https://github.com/USERNAME/REPONAME.git
    git push origin -u master
```

Finally, type ``cotk run`` to run your model and upload to cotk dashboard.

``cotk`` will automatically collect your git repo, username, commit and ``result.json``
to the cotk dashboard (TO BE ONLINE).The dashboard is a website where you can manage
your experiments or share results with others.

FILL AN IMAGE HERE

If you don't want to use cotk's dashboard, you can also choose to directly upload your model
to github.

Use ``cotk run --only-run`` instead of ``cotk run``, you will find a ``.model_config.json``
is generated. Commit the file and push it to github, the other can automatically download
your model as the way described in next section.

.. note::

    The reproducibility should be maintained by the author. We only make sure all the input
    is the same, but difference can be introduced by different random seed, device or other
    affects. Before you upload, run ``cotk run --only-run`` twice and find whether the results
    is the same.

### Reproduce Experiments

You can download others' model in dashboard
and try to reproduce their results.

```bash
    cotk download ID
```

The ``ID`` comes from dashboard id.
``cotk`` will download the codes from dashboard and tell you how to run the models.

```none
INFO: Fetching USERNAME/REPO/COMMIT
13386B [00:00, 54414.25B/s]
INFO: Codes from USERNAME/REPO/COMMIT fetched.
INFO: Model running cmd written in run_model.sh
Model running cmd:  cd ./PATH && cotk run --only-run --entry main
```

Type ``cotk run --only-run --entry main`` will reproduce the same experiments.

You can also download directly from github if the maintainer has set the ``.model_config.json``.

```bash
    cotk download USER/REPO/COMMIT
```

``cotk`` will download the codes from github and generate commands by the config file.

### Predefined Models

We have provided some baselines for the classical tasks, see :ref:`Model Zoo <model_zoo>` in docs for details.


You can also use ``cotk download thu-coai/MODEL_NAME/master`` to get the codes.
